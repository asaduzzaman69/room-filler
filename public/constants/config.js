          "Green Spring Golf Course was the one that started the golf boom in St. George. There were a couple other decent municipal golf courses in town in the early 90’s, but when Green Spring Golf Course was built, it raised the bar for the quality of golf in the area. To this day the Par 3, fifth and the Par 4, sixth are two of the most memorable holes in the entire area.",
          "When Green Spring opened in 1990, it drew considerable attention with its signature holes taking advantage of red-rock canyons and sandstone outcroppings. Interestingly, and in contrast, there were natural desert springs and wetlands water features on the property, and those areas offered large cottonwood trees, which created a cool change of the look on a few holes of the back nine.",

Eight of the first nine holes have water features, so you’ve got to be accurate.  But the fairways are wide, so there’s usually a safe place to play.  The back nine, however, is a different story.

Eight out of nine holes on the front nine feature either a lake or the Santa Clara River as scenic challenges to par. The back 9, slightly longer than the front nine, adds the element of risk/reward and allows the player to recover shots lost on the front nine. Southgate Golf Course is a par-70 layout which is enjoyable for all levels of ability.",

The front nine meanders along the beautiful Santa Clara River while the back nine traverses the foothills of Tonaquint Mountain providing stunning views of downtown St. George with its red rock backdrop. Southgate is a great golf course for those looking for an enjoyable round of golf as opposed to a brutal test of your skills. Southgate Golf Course also features a game improvement center with award-winning PGA professionals and instruction programs.",

After removing several feet of topsoil, he came across a thick sandstone layer. This layer was the “paleontological jackpot”: dinosaur footprints! Dr. Johnson and his wife, LaVerna, decided to share the tracks with the world, opening their farm to the public. Within a few months, trained paleontologists from around the state, plus hundreds of volunteers, helped uncover thousands of fossils.

The Lowland zone is a little more fragile, so it’s set aside to protect sensitive species. You’ll need to carefully hike only on established trails and stay in developed campgrounds.

Unlike most parks, instead of grass fields and swing sets, the park is covered in gorgeous red rock formations that you can climb on and walkthrough. What the park is most well known for is the small slot canyon at the back of the park and the Sugar Loaf (a.k.a. the Dixie Rock) You can climb up to the Dixie Rock and view the entire St George Valley. This spot is great to take pictures and we have even seen someone hold their wedding on top of the formation. This spot is famous throughout the St George area and is a must-see while you are in town. The second well-known spot in pioneer park is the slot canyon. going back about 200 yards the first 150 everyone can walkthrough. It is the last 50 that brings people in every weekend. The slot narrows down to the extent that people enjoy trying to wiggle their way through the slot. Children and adults alike love this easy access experience. Along with the red rock formations around the slot that you can explore there is also access to the Desert Preserve Pioneer Park Trail and a pavilion for the family to a picnic at. If you can find it there is also a brick pioneer house hidden among the rocks.
