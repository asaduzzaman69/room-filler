The scenic drive up S.R. 128 along the Colorado River is your introduction to Fisher Towers, a cluster of soaring sandstone towers on BLM land northeast of Moab. After a short drive on a graded dirt road, you’ll park at a trailhead and primitive campground among big-wall climbers. Look for them as tiny dots on their ascents up the jagged monoliths as you rise and descend along the rugged contours of the eroding landscape. Highlights along the hiking trail include Titan (the tallest of the towers), views to Castleton Tower and a culminating panorama that must be very near the end of the earth.",

A good place to start is S.R. 95, a rolling and scenic byway that from Blanding, Utah, on the east, rises up over the Comb Ridge of the Shash Jaa unit before approaching some of this remote and rugged area’s most accessible hikes. A stop at the Butler Wash overlook is a good introduction (1 mile, round-trip, with interpretive signage by the Friends of Cedar Mesa), but give yourself a couple of hours to hit the South Fork of Mule Canyon, on county road 263, east of the well-marked Mule Canyon turnoff and just before mile marker 102. Drive this dirt road to the fee box ($2/person) then continue about a quarter mile to the trailhead for Mule Canyon. The mile to House on Fire trail is mostly flat, but it crisscrosses a sandy and rocky wash and is mostly exposed; hike with care and be sure to carry plenty of water. The ruin itself is not marked, so keep your head up and watch for the distinctive rock dwelling on the right. (Additional ruins exist further up the canyon.) When visiting ancient ruins, always practice Respect and Protect principles. Do not climb in or on ruins. Do not move rocks or anything else. While they have lasted for hundreds of years, they are fragile. Instead, notice the ancient thumb prints in the adobe mortar and the assembly of stones and imagine eeking out a life in this remote territory in a sea of canyons in the heart of the Colorado Plateau."

Gooseberry Mesa, a short drive from nearby Hurricane, Utah, is positioned to have vantage of it all, and the wind-sculpted rock surface atop this large plateau creates a world all its own. This gem of BLM land is most well known as a mountain biking destination and attracts riders from all over the world.

At dusk, the sun saturates them and they turn to imposing silhouettes against a moon-lit sky or shadows beneath a pristine starry sky. The trails of Kodachrome Basin State Park weave among 67 colorful monolithic stone spires, called sedimentary pipes, and every trail is spectacular. The park offers trails for virtually every ability, from the half-mile interpretive Nature Trail to the much longer 3- or 6-mile double loop of the Panorama Trail, which reveals much of the park’s fascinating geology.

Santa Clara is only five minutes away from the beautiful St. George Utah real estate of Tenaya Sands.

By 1891 the mines had produced about 25 million dollars worth of ore. But the veins played out quickly and the town went bust. The old Silver Reef Wells Fargo Express office is on the National Historical Register and is now houses a small museum. Foundations of a few other old buildings can be seen.

It was originally designed with two large assembly halls like the earlier Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples. The lower Assembly Hall was partitioned with curtains to provide the ordinance rooms for the Endowment Ceremony. In 1938, the lower Assembly Hall was rebuilt with permanent walls dividing it into four ordinance rooms. The four ordinance rooms were later changed into the present three rooms, at the time the endowment ceremony was changed from a live presentation to one presented on film. In the 1970s, the temple was closed for extensive remodeling. LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball rededicated it in 1975.",

Judd`s Store was constructed and opened in 1911 in front of the house Thomas Judd purchased from Joseph Bentley in 1908 and across the street from the new Woodward School. It was built of the same thickness of locally manufactured adobes that had been used in the home. Thomas Judd bought out the inventory of the store maintained by the Bentley`s in the Pratt-Bentley Home. At some point, it was connected to the front of the house, but that connection was later removed to restore the store to its original condition. The store was very successful, carrying general merchandise, and catering to the needs of the sheep and cattlemen which were numerous in early days of Dixie. When Thomas` son, Joseph Judd, took over, he continued to run the store but boarded up the rest of the structure. The store remained in the Judd family`s possession until 1982. At that time, the city wanted to condemn the store and turn it into a parking lot. Cooler heads prevailed and Dr. Mark & Barbara Greene purchased the building making it into a focal point of their Green Gate Village. The store has been restored and is still open today. To step into Judd`s Store is to step back in time. Particularly outstanding is the ceiling which the Greenes rescued from another business establishment of pioneer days, Snow`s Furniture Store, which was located one block to the east.",

Tucked into the Red Rocks overlooking the St George Valley, Pioneer Park provides an afternoon of relaxing and fun. Unlike most parks, instead of grass fields and swing sets, the park is covered in gorgeous red rock formations that you can climb on and walkthrough. What the park is most well known for is the small slot canyon at the back of the park and the Sugar Loaf (a.k.a. the Dixie Rock) You can climb up to the Dixie Rock and view the entire St George Valley. This spot is great to take pictures and we have even seen someone hold their wedding on top of the formation. This spot is famous throughout the St George area and is a must-see while you are in town. The second well-known spot in pioneer park is the slot canyon. going back about 200 yards the first 150 everyone can walkthrough. It is the last 50 that brings people in every weekend. The slot narrows down to the extent that people enjoy trying to wiggle their way through the slot. Children and adults alike love this easy access experience. Along with the red rock formations around the slot that you can explore there is also access to the Desert Preserve Pioneer Park Trail and a pavilion for the family to a picnic at. If you can find it there is also a brick pioneer house hidden among the rocks. Upcoming is the Red Hills Desert Garden, which will have fish viewing areas the put at eye level with the fish and floral setups that will allow you to learn what plants grow the region.",
